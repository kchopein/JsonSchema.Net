# JsonSchema.Net
Every contract you expose to the outside world will eventually change, forcing you to manage different versions of it. Most of the times the changes are not huge, so transforming a message based on an old version of the contract into a new one based on the current version should not be hard. We do it all the time!

The idea behind this little library is to define a way to deal with this in a methodical way, avoiding code duplication. Not rocket science but still something that can be improved.

## Just starting

This project was born 2 days ago at the moment of writing this, so it's still in a very, very, very early stage. Actually I don't spect a lot of people reading this (no one actually). However, you never know, so... if you think this can be usefult and want to contribute, please do it!
